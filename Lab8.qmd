### T-test

For this question, we will use classical t-tests and Bayesian analogues.

#### 1.
Use the OK Cupid dataset and test the following claim, the mean height OK Cupid respondents reporting their body type as `athletic` is different than 70 inches. 

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
library(tidyverse)
okc <- read_csv('http://www.math.montana.edu/ahoegh/teaching/stat408/datasets/OKCupid_profiles_clean.csv')
```

a. (4 points)

Use a t-test `t.test()` to answer this research question. Print statistical output **AND** summarize your results in writing.

b. (8 points)

Use an equivalent Bayesian model specified in JAGS to answer this research question. 

1. Write out your statistical model and priors.
2. Assume that your ROPE is 1/4 inch. Print statistical output, create a data visualization, **AND** summarize your results in writing.

#### 2.
Now consider whether there is a  height difference between  OK Cupid respondents 
self-reporting their body type as "athletic" and those self-reporting their body type as "fit"
