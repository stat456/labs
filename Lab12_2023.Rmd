For this question, we will use a historical data set with NCAA tournament results.

```{r}
library(rjags)
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
ncaa <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stat456/labs/main/Lab12_data.csv') %>%
  filter(Seed.Diff != 0) %>%
  mutate(Seed.Diff = -1 * Seed.Diff,
         SAG.Diff = -1 * SAG.Diff)
```

#### 1. (4 points)

Create two figures to explore the impact of `Seed.Diff` and `SAG.Diff` on `Score.Diff.` Add a smoother line to approximate the relationship.


#### 2. (4 points)
Write a short caption to accompany each figure.


#### 3. (4 points)
Deviance Information Criteria (DIC) is a Bayesian analog to AIC. Consider the two model below, which do you prefer and why?

```{r}
# Model String
modelString = "model {
  for ( i in 1:N ) {
    y[i] ~ dnorm(beta0 + beta1 * x[i], 1/sigma^2) # sampling model
  }
  beta0 ~ dnorm(M0,1/S0^2)
  beta1 ~ dnorm(M1, 1 / S1^2)
  sigma ~ dunif(0,C)
} "
writeLines( modelString, con='NORMmodel.txt')
```

```{r}
# Runs JAGS Model: Seeds
seeds_model <- jags.model( file = "NORMmodel.txt", 
                           data =  list(y = ncaa$Score.Diff, 
                                        x = ncaa$Seed.Diff,
                                        N = nrow(ncaa),

                         n.chains = 2, n.adapt = 1000)
update(seeds_model, n.iter = 1000)

seeds_coda <- coda.samples(seeds_model, 
                          variable.names = c('beta0','beta1', 'sigma'), 
                          n.iter = 5000)

#### 4. (4 points)

Fit the best possible model using DIC as your criteria. You may want to consider interactions and/or non-linearity terms.


#### 5. (4 points)

Write out the formal model you've selected in part 4, including all priors.


#### 6. (4 points)

Interpret your parameters in the model and summarize your findings. Assume you are telling your parents how statistics can be useful for filling out an NCAA bracket.


#### 7. (4 points)

Construct a posterior predictive distribution to calculate the winning probability of the following games, Note your model is likely set to predict the point spread for the higher seed:

1. Montana State (Seed: 14, Sagarin: 133) vs. Kansas State (Seed: 3, Sagarin: 18)
2. Purdue (Seed: 1, Sagarin: 9) vs. Farleigh Dickinson (Seed: 16, Sagarin: 310)
3. Arizona (Seed: 2, Sagarin: 10) vs. Princeton (Seed 15:, Sagarin: 118)
4. Connecticut (Seed: 4, Sagarin: 4) vs. Iona (Seed: 13, Sagarin: 86)
